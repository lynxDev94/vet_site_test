# Introduction

A veterinary website is more than just an online presence—it’s a crucial tool for attracting new clients, retaining existing ones, and ensuring seamless communication. But what truly makes a veterinary website **great** from a developer’s perspective? Let’s dive into the essential features that every veterinary website should have.
